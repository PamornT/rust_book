### How to implement extra feature to `lib`.

- lib `hi.rs`

  ```rust
  // ğŸ‘‡ exclamation ! mean apply to whole file.
  #![cfg(feature = "hi")]

  pub fn hi(){
    println!(":#?", base64::encode("hi"));
  }
  ```

- lib `Cargo.toml`

  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "foo"

  [dependencies]
  # optional true = include only when need ğŸ‘‡
  base64 =  { version = "0.13", optional = true }

  [features]
  hi = ["dep:base64"] # ğŸ‘ˆ related crate.
  ```

### How to use extra feature from `lib`.

- app `Cargo.toml`

  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "bar"

  [dependencies]
  # To include feature named "hi" ğŸ‘‡
  foo = { version = "1, features = ["hi"] }
  ```
