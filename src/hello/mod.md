  <p>Let's learn together ✨</p>
</div>

## Welcome

- ✨ This book is like random working `gist` + `stack overflow` + `cheat sheet` + `short note` for `Rust` and `Wasm`.
- 🚧 This book is ongoing, feel free to help.

## Goals

- 🏔 Provide smoothed `Rust` and `Wasm` learning curve by working examples.
- 🛣 Provide a `happy case` examples (failure case is optional).
- 🛠 Regularly maintain and update to keep things fresh.

## Non-Goals

- We won't cover topics that we didn't have a chance to use it yet e.g. [`macros`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html), [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/),`FFI`, [embed device](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/).
- We maybe cover `game`, `3d`, `ml` topic if we get enough funding and time on earth.
